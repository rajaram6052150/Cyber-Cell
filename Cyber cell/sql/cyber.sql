On 14 & 15/08/2023  I came across an online opportunity that claimed to be affiliated with Google and promised individuals payment of 150 rupees for each task they completed as part of a \"Google review work\" program. Eager to earn some extra income  I initially registered for the program and began completing the assigned tasks.However  after completing several tasks  I was informed that in order to progress to the next level and access my earnings  I needed to invest a significant sum of money  which totaled (5000 + 32000) 37 000 rupees. Believing that this was a legitimate opportunity  I made the investment as instructed. Totally i lost 37000/-.To my dismay  it became clear that this was an elaborate scam  and I have not received any earnings or any means of contacting the individuals behind this fraudulent operation since making the investment. It is evident that I have been defrauded of my hard-earned money.again asked me to pay 38000/- and if I do this I can get up to 172200/-.Company Name - AJ Marketing UPI ID 1 - eazypay.0000069982@iciciUPI ID 2 - Spoojan2571@yblUPI ID 3 - babymondal.39650669@hdfcbankI am taking this step to report this incident and seek your assistance in investigating and taking action. kindly request that you take the necessary steps to address this issue promptly.Mohankumar8248201526ravi.rmohan@gmail.co', 'Online Financial Fraud', 'Fraud Call/Vishing', 'Closed', '9/9/2023', '19/09/2023', '8/10/2023 18:44', 'Mohankumar ', '8248201526', 'ravi.rmohan@gmail.com', '52/40 KAVUNDAM PALAYAM COIMBATORE  Pincode :641030', '', '', '', '32000', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'N', 'N', ''),
