He instructed me to go to a Jewellery shop in Karol Bagh  Delhi to collect the cash of 40Lakhs in exchange for 43010USDT. I needed to deposit the money in my bank account. Upon reaching there he insisted i wait and collect the money from that shop while i transfer my USDT to him immediately. A person called Manish (9711217643) was at the shop assisting with the cash and he said Bhavish has not transferred him the USDT yet that he received from me. So the Scammer collected the USDT from me and did not transfer the tokens to him. But Manish only prepared 17L and not 40L as promised by Bhavish so we do have suspicions on Manish as well. Overnight  i have been tracking the USDT he stole from us and he has been transferring them to another wallet - i have attached the evidence of his illegal transfers.

285,22912230076787,TAMIL NADU,COIMBATORE CITY,PEELAMEDU,Good Morning  I took a loan from the mobile app named Cash Guide. Unfortunately   I wasn’t able to repay it before the due date. Though  I made partial payment and an assurance that I will pay the loan within 2 days despite the higher interest rate. But the loan app’s collection team sent an intimidating message and my morph edited pictures to my wife   mother   and few of my friends circle by threatening to pay back the loan. This has created a very bad impression on me among my family member which is leading me to suicide. I told the person that I would report a complaint but that didn’t matter to him because he made sure that nothing can be done against them. I request you to take an immediate action against these type of Mobile loan apps.

303,22912230076649,TAMIL NADU,COIMBATORE CITY,PEELAMEDU,I have given the car for repair and services to the merchant SIDDHESH Cars but when we received the car back on 31st march 2023  they refused to show the car or explain the repairs done. The only visible changes made are paint and repairs covered by insurance  those cannot be faked but the other repairs and works mentioned in the bill are not done. They also damaged the gas component  causing us to use petrol till now. They also damaged perfectly good parts which are mentioned in detail in the attachments. They also charged 11 percent extra from the original amount they proposed citing MDR charges for card payment. They also refused to show or give us the car unless we paid first  which we did not agree  causing a lot of mental anguish and having to wait for hours in the store. We wanted to check the car for a few days for quality of repair and then make payment. They refused to show us the replaced parts. Only a few were there  rest they did not provide  meaning all the work in the bill had not been done. And yet they charged us for the entirety of the bill. We also complained to one of the workers that the sideview mirror  right side backdoor and AC Media covering was damaged during their service. They refused to repair them. They also faked our response when we raised the chargeback with the bank for not providing the services as billed. Due to the falsified mail  SBI team had closed the chargeback without recourse causing us much distress. Now they made a false complaint,Online Financial Fraud,Debit/Credit Card Fraud/Sim Swap Fraud,NC Registered,31/03/2023,21/12/2023,21/12/2023 20:25:56,Gurusamy,9488229310,Gurusamy8E@gmail.com,    Pincode :641004,BASKARAN K  Muthu Kannan,7373787825  7373787836,Mobile Number,45000
